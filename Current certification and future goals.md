# Current and future qualifications
There are so many interesting things about cybersecurity that I do not know what to focus on.

### Completed
<details>
<summary> Sy0-601   Comptia Security+</summary>

```
The backbone of my cybersecurity knowledge so far. 
I really enjoyed it. It not only gave me a broad view of the cybersecurity field,
but also feels more comprehensive and extensive than many people realize.
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>AZ-900     Microsoft Azure Fundamentals</summary>

```
My second certification. I felt I needed a Microsoft certification of some kind. 
I really prefer Linux, but Microsoft dominates and it was easy to pick up.
```
</details>

### In progress
<details>
<summary> ISC2 CC   Certified in Cybersecurity </summary>

```
Easy after Comptia Security+, but I really like focus on:

(IRP) Incident Response Plan, 
(BCP) Business Continuity Plan and
(DRP) Disaster Recovery Plan.

I want to explore more.
```
</details>
<details>
<summary> SC-900    Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals </summary>

```
Continuation of Microsoft Fundamental certifications. Also easy after Comptia Security+. 
I just need time to go through the material.
I watch Pete Zerger SC-900.
```
</details>

<details>
<summary> HTB   Hack The Box - labs writeups </summary>

```
I think I have finished 7 labs before that github idea. 
I will come back to it, once I finish CC and SC-900.
I will document the ones I completed as well.
```
</details>

### Easy but possibly time-consuming

<details>
<summary> Comptia Linux+ Certification </summary>

```
Years of using linux with no certification.
There is new (as per Jult'25) Comptia Linux+ V8 certification with elements of AI.
```
</details>


<details>
<summary>Python     Progamming Language</summary>

```
https://learnpython.org/
https://pll.harvard.edu/subject/python
So much to explore.
```
</details>

<details>
<summary> Burp Suite    Tool for web application security </summary>

```
Barely scratched the surface. It looks like it's worth the effort.
```
</details>

<details>
<summary> Ansible    Configuration management </summary>

```
Should be easy, just when?
```
</details>

### Future challenges I am looking forward to
<details >
<summary>CISM   ISACA Certified Information Security Manager</summary>

```
ISC2 CC deepen my interest in IRP, BCP and DRP.

Prerequisites:  having a minimum of five years of professional work experience in 
information security management (DOH!)

Just look at 4 main domains of CISM:

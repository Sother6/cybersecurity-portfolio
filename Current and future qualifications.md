# Current and future qualifications
There are so many interesting things about cybersecurity that I do not know what to focus on.

### Completed
<details>
<summary> Sy0-601   Comptia Security+</summary>

```
The backbone of my cybersecurity knowledge so far. 
I really enjoyed it. It not only gave me a broad view of the cybersecurity field,
but also feels more comprehensive and extensive than many people realize.
```

<details>
<summary>AZ-900     Microsoft Azure Fundamentals</summary>

```
My second certification. I felt I needed a Microsoft certification of some kind. 
I really prefer Linux, but Microsoft dominates and it was easy to pick up.
```

### In progress

<details>
<summary> ISC2 CC   Certified in Cybersecurity </summary>

```
Easy after Comptia Security+, but I really like focus on:
(IRP) Incident Response Plan, (BCP) Business Continuity Plan and
(DRP) Disaster Recovery Plan.
I want to explore more.
```

</details>

<details>
<summary> SC-900    Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals </summary>

```
Continuation of Microsoft Fundamental certifications. Also easy after Comptia Security+. 
I just need time to go through the material.
I watch Pete Zerger SC-900.
```
</details>

<details>
<summary> HTB   Hack The Box - labs writeups </summary>

```
I think I have finished 7 labs before that github idea. 
I will come back to it, once I finish CC and SC-900.
I will document the ones I finish as well.
```

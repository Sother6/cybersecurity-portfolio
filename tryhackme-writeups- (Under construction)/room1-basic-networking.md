# TryHackMe - Basic Networking

**Date:** Sept 2025  
**Objective:** Understand TCP/IP layers and practice packet analysis with Wireshark.

## Key Learnings
- Difference between TCP vs UDP
- How to capture and analyze packets in Wireshark
- Identified common ports (HTTP/80, HTTPS/443, DNS/53, SSH/22)
- Used `ping`, `tracert`, and `netstat` for troubleshooting

## Reflection
This exercise helped reinforce how packet headers reveal protocol details.  
Next step: practice filtering malicious traffic in Wireshark.
